This gives equations which can be used to compute the rates of electron-transfer reactions in the nonadiabatic (golden-rule) limit numerically within a semiclassical approximation. The multidimensional ring-polymer instanton trajectories are obtained efficiently by minimization of the action. In this form, comparison with Wolynes' quantum instanton method [P. G. Wolynes, J.

abstract = {We present semiclassical approximations to Green's functions of multidimensional systems, extending Gutzwiller's work to the classically forbidden region. Based on steepest-descent integrals over these functions, we derive an instanton method for computing the rate of nonadiabatic reactions, such as electron transfer, in the weak-coupling limit, where Fermi's golden-rule can be employed. This generalizes Marcus theory to systems for which the environment free-energy curves are not harmonic and where nuclear tunnelling plays a role. The derivation avoids using the Im F method or short-time approximations to real-time correlation functions. A clear physical interpretation of the nuclear tunnelling processes involved in an electron-transfer reaction is thus provided. In Paper II [J. O. Richardson, J. Chem.

The time dependent electronic Schrodinger equation is solved self-consistently with the classical mechanical equations of motion of the atoms. At each integration time step a decision is made whether to switch electronic states, according to probabilistic "fewest switches" algorithm. If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy. The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations for three one-dimensional, two-state models, two of which have been specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical-quantal dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial indications are encouraging. The model should be applicable to a wide variety of gas-phase and condensed-phase phenomena occurring even down to thermal energies.},

In condensed phase processes, the short lifetimes of the relevant correlation functions make it possible to implement the procedure within the frozen Gaussian method. Furthermore, because of the large density of states involved, which implies fast dephasing, incoherent superpositions of frozen Gaussian trajectories may be used for the evaluation of the rate. The method is tested using two simple exactly soluble models.

Calculations for three states systems, varying the through–bond coupling constant, show that the nonadiabatic instanton theory reproduces the results of perturbation and adiabatic instanton theories in the limits of small and large coupling constants, respectively. In the absence of through–space coupling, the crossover between the two limits is smooth and monotonic. However, in the presence of through–space coupling, the crossover pattern becomes sensitive to the relative phase of the two electronic channels and demonstrates substantial interference effects.

Here, we provide a derivation showing that the two versions of the theory are exactly equivalent. Unlike a previous derivation (which was restricted to a system-bath model), our derivation is completely general, and thus establishes that the “Im F” premise, which is behind such methods as quantum transition-state theory and ring polymer molecular dynamics rate-theory, is correct in the steepest-descent limit.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that the ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method is equivalent to an automated and approximate implementation of the "Im F" version of semiclassical instanton theory when used to calculate reaction rates in the deep-tunneling regime. This explains why the RPMD method is often reliable in this regime and also shows how it can be systematically improved. The geometry of the beads at the transition state on the ring-polymer potential surface describes a finite-difference approximation to the "instanton" trajectory (a periodic orbit in imaginary time beta variant Planck's over 2pi on the inverted potential surface). The deep-tunneling RPMD rate is an approximation to the rate obtained by applying classical transition-state theory (TST) in ring-polymer phase-space using the optimal dividing surface; this TST rate is in turn an approximation to a free-energy version of the Im F instanton rate. The optimal dividing surface is in general a function of several modes of the ring polymer, which explains why centroid-based quantum-TSTs break down at low temperatures for asymmetric reaction barriers. Numerical tests on one-dimensional models show that the RPMD rate tends to overestimate deep-tunneling rates for asymmetric barriers and underestimate them for symmetric barriers, and we explain that this is likely to be a general trend. The ability of the RPMD method to give a dividing-surface-independent rate in the deep-tunneling regime is shown to be a consequence of setting the bead-masses equal to the physical mass.},

A powerful theoretical formalism has been developed that describes ET rates in terms of two parameters: the nuclear reorganization energy ($\gamma$) and the electroniccoupling strength (HAB). Studies of ET reactions in ruthenium-modified proteins have probed $\gamma$ and HAB in several metalloproteins (cytochrome c, myoglobin, azurin). This work has shown that protein reorganization energies are sensitive to the medium surrounding the redox sites and that an aqueous environment, in particular, leads to large reorganization energies. Analyses of electronic-coupling strengths suggest that the efficiency of long-range ET depends on the protein secondary structure: $\beta$ sheets appear to mediate coupling more efficiently than $\alpha$-helical structures, and hydrogen bonds play a critical role in both.},

abstract = {Surprisingly, there exists a quantum flux-side time-correlation function which has a non-zero t → 0+ limit and thus yields a rigorous quantum generalization of classical transition-state theory (TST). In this Part I of two articles, we introduce the new time-correlation function and derive its t → 0+ limit. The new ingredient is a generalized Kubo transform which allows the flux and side dividing surfaces to be the same function of path-integral space. Choosing this function to be a single point gives a t → 0+ limit which is identical to an expression introduced on heuristic grounds by Wigner in 1932; however, this expression does not give positive-definite quantum statistics, causing it to fail while still in the shallow-tunnelling regime. Positive-definite quantum statistics is obtained only if the dividing surface is invariant to imaginary-time translation, in which case the t → 0+ limit is identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. The RPMD-TST rate is not a strict upper bound to the exa...},

@article{Richardson2017,
abstract = {Semiclassical instanton theory is used to study the quantum effects of tunnelling and delocalization in molecular systems. An analysis of the approximations involved in the method is presented based on a recent first-principles derivation of instanton rate theory [J. Chem. Phys., 2016, 144, 114106]. It is known that the standard instanton method is unable to accurately compute thermal rates near the crossover temperature. The causes of this problem are identified and an improved method is proposed, whereby an instanton approximation to the microcanonical rate is defined and integrated numerically to obtain a thermal rate at any temperature. No new computational algorithms are required, but only data analysis of a number of standard instanton calculations.},

@article{Pollak2005,
abstract = {A brief history is presented, outlining the development of rate theory during the past century. Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, consid...},

abstract = {The calculation of absolute reaction rates is formulated in terms of quantities which are available from the potential surfaces which can be constructed at the present time. The probability of the activated state is calculated using ordinary statistical mechanics. This probability multiplied by the rate of decomposition gives the specific rate of reaction. The occurrence of quantized vibrations in the activated complex, in degrees of freedom which are unquantized in the original molecules, leads to relative reaction rates for isotopes quite different from the rates predicted using simple kinetic theory. The necessary conditions for the general statistical treatment to reduce to the usual kinetic treatment are given.},

No assumptions, however, such as separability of the Hamiltonian, vibrationally adiabatic motion along a reaction coordinate, etc., are incorporated. Application is made to the collinear H+H2reaction, and agreement with accurate quantum scattering calculations is found to be reasonably good. The results indicate that transition state theory—provided no assumptions of separability are included—is probably as accurate quantum mechanically as it has been found to be classically for describing the threshold of chemical reactions with an activation barrier.},
